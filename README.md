<h1>Is That My Phone? Nope, Just a Calculator</h1>
<p>This is a simple implementation of a basic calculator using vanilla JavaScript. This project was created to practice and demonstrate basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills.</p>
<h3>How Is This Calculator Unique?</h3>
<p>What sets this implementation apart from others is the use of HTML/CSS to create a nearly perfect replication of the user interface of the iPhone Calculator app, 
however it currently only features the basic functionality of a calculator, and not the complete functionality of the iPhone app.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Addition</li>
  <li>Subtraction</li>
  <li>Multiplication</li>
  <li>Division</li>
</ul>

- UI made to replicate iPhone Calculator app
  - Includes live system time display
  - Includes images to emulate wifi, signal, and battery icons
